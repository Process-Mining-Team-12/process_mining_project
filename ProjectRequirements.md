| Task | Done |
|------|------|
| I have performed some correct/coherent modelling of a process using a formal language to describe processes (e.g., Petri net) | [ ] |
| I have verified the correct behavior (e.g., using the “token game”) of a process represented in a formal language (e.g., Petri net) and investigated some of its basic properties (e.g., deadlock-free, bounded) | [ ] |
| I have compared different process mining techniques (e.g., discovery, conformance) and discussed which to use to achieve my purposes | [ ] |
| I have discussed, interpreted and evaluated the outcomes of the process mining activity | [ ] |
| I have tested, discussed and compared different process mining algorithms in the context of the given problem (e.g., for the discovery, Inductive Miner vs Heuristics Miner) | [ ] |
| I have used and reported on state-of-the-art of available technologies, both commercial products and open source tools | [ ] |
| I have manipulated the raw event log to perform certain analyses | [ ] |
| I have answered domain related questions using the results of process mining | [ ] |
